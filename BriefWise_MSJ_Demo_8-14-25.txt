## RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT CRANE CO.’S MOTION TO DISMISS

### I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff respectfully submits this Response in Opposition to Defendant Crane Co.’s Motion to Dismiss. Defendant’s arguments misconstrue Pennsylvania law governing product liability, exposure standards, and the sufficiency of asbestos-related pleadings. Binding appellate authority holds that a plaintiff alleging regular, frequent, and proximate exposure to asbestos-containing components—such as packing and gaskets on pumps—states a valid claim. Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion should be denied in full.

---

### II. STATEMENT OF RELEVANT FACTS
Plaintiff worked as a pipefitter at Bethlehem Steel between 1970 and 1980, where he was exposed on over 100 occasions to asbestos-containing gaskets and packing on Crane pumps. Plaintiff performed tasks such as removing and replacing these components during equipment maintenance, generating visible asbestos dust. No warnings were provided. Defendant Crane Co. manufactured and supplied the asbestos-containing products and/or failed to warn of their dangers.

---

### III. LEGAL STANDARD
In Pennsylvania, a complaint will survive a motion to dismiss if it sets forth facts sufficient to establish a legally cognizable claim.  
See *Bailets v. Pa. Tpk. Comm’n*, 181 A.3d 324, 333 (Pa. 2018).  
In asbestos cases, a plaintiff must demonstrate exposure that was frequent, regular, and proximate to the defendant’s product.  
See *Gregg v. V-J Auto Parts Co.*, 943 A.2d 216, 225 (Pa. 2007).

---

### IV. ARGUMENT

#### A. Plaintiff Has Pled “Frequent, Regular, and Proximate” Exposure
Under *Gregg*, the plaintiff need not prove the specific quantity of fibers inhaled, but rather that the exposure occurred with sufficient frequency, regularity, and proximity to the defendant’s product.  
Here, Plaintiff alleges:
- Over 100 instances of direct exposure,
- In an occupational setting,
- With no protective measures or warnings,
- During the removal and replacement of asbestos-containing components on Crane pumps.

This is more than sufficient to state a cause of action.  
See also *Krentz v. Consol. Rail Corp.*, 910 A.2d 20, 29–30 (Pa. 2006).

#### B. Defendant’s Argument Regarding Component Parts Fails Under Controlling Law
Defendant may argue that gaskets and packing were “component parts” not manufactured by Crane. However, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has rejected narrow interpretations:

> "The manufacturer of a product that requires the use of asbestos-containing components, or is foreseeably modified to include such components, may be held liable."
>— *Sullivan v. Werner Co.*, 253 A.3d 730, 741 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2021) (citing *Schmidt v. Boardman Co.*, 11 A.3d 924 (Pa. 2011)).

Crane pumps were designed and installed with asbestos components integral to their operation. Thus, liability is properly pled.

#### C. Warning Deficiencies Are Independently Actionable
Even if Crane did not manufacture the asbestos-containing parts, it still owed a duty to warn of foreseeable dangers.  
See *Tincher v. Omega Flex, Inc.*, 104 A.3d 328, 382–83 (Pa. 2014).

---

### V. CONCLUSION
Plaintiff has adequately pled a cause of action under Pennsylvania law. The allegations meet the *Gregg* standard, and Defendant’s motion is premature and unsupported.

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court **DENY** Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss in its entirety.
